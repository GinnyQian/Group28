# Background 

The coronavirus pandemic has spurred the adoption of distance learning at all education levels. Thousands of colleges and universities, as well as hundreds of thousands of K-12 institutions, closed around the world. The mass transition will be a proving ground for online education. Teachers, parents and children have an increasing demand for online learning resources.  Members of our team have discovered these eager needs and are keen to develop education-related products.  Bringing vivid education to thousands of households with technology is the original intention of our design.



There are many amazing products for 3D starry sky visualization. Websites such as Scope and mobile applications such as Solar Walk can be used as reference.  However, these websites are mainly entertainment. After questionnaire surveys and user feedback, we finally decided to focus our products on education, integrating contextualized teaching and consolidating knowledge to achieve the purpose of edutainment.   In addition, the members of this group are novices in program development and website design. Choosing the general education of children's astronomy subject, a field where the predecessors have rich experience, is a good start to accumulate experience.



We hope that in the future, such an online learning model with contextualized exploration and instant answering and consolidation will not only be used in astronomy, but also in children's education in more disciplines.
