**Our working practices**

In the part of Sprints, we use the software - Zoho for Agile project management. Penghe is token as the scrum leader to promote project progress while Zhenni focuses on collecting and analyzing user data because of her excellent PR ability. Given Bingli is good at arrange program, she is mainly responsible for managing and maintaining Zoho accounts. And Jing and Yi are interested in technical development, so they are the in the team.

In the communication, we use several different communicate channels to keep a close connection, for example, we use Wechat, Teams and offline meeting at the same time.

In the daily standup meeting, we host this part in WeChat group at 12.00pm every day. During the meeting, everyone would share what they did today, what will they do tomorrow and what problem they face now. And our leader Penghe would organize us to solve the issues we faced.

With regard to issue management, what we mentioned before, we discuss and ask a question in the daily standup meeting, and our project leader would determine whether we need a new meeting to solve it and how to solve it.

As for group development, we use Zoho and Github to arrange all the materials we need. Our development goal is to meet customer needs, so our development direction is based on user feedback. Besides, we subdivided our goal into 2 parts, now and future, to support us do better.

**Evaluation of working practice**

We have the prefect project division as each member could play to their best advantage. During the project development cycle, we have a close cooperation, so our project can run smoothly. However, the schedule at the beginning of the project is not reasonable, for example, our questionnaire is not timely so that we spent loads of time to modify the content of project. But luckily, we found out it in time and made changes to avoid lacking time in the later period.

In terms of communication, we chose the most suitable communication method according to your actual situation. Take WeChat as an example, which is a very popular social media in China. As a Chinese, we login to WeChat nearly every half an hour on average. So chosen it as our main communicate channel could ensure we receive new messages in the shortest time. Moreover, we would host a offline revise meeting when we decide to compete a sprint and start a new one. For us, face-to-face meeting is exactly suitable for making an important decision. But we are also struggling with the jet lag as our team not in one time zone.

As for our daily meeting, we all think it’s a brilliant idea for us complete our project step by step and problem also would be solved in time, but we also need to recognize that we fell into a lazy situation in the later stage because we don’t have relative punishment. 

Then, in the part of issue management, we would feedback problem to our leader for decision-making, so almost of all issues had been effectively and quickly resolved. 

Finally, when it comes to the Group development, we are happy that our group has a clear division, so every member will not too free or too busy. Besides, through daily meeting, we also can discuss our situation and get help from others. More importantly, even if the coursework is finished, we find a big interested in this project and we will continue to develop it in the future. During the whole development period, we could recognize we need spend more time and labor in technical support and technical development.
