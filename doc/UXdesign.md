# UX Design

The UX design of our project is divided into the following four key phases: product definition, research, analysis, and design.

## Product definition

product definition is the phrase where we need to understand the backgroud information and the necessity of exitence for our project before create anything. During this phase, we had brainstorm around the concept of the project with stakeholders.

Our design inspiration comes from Stellarium Astronomy Software, which is an open-source free-software Planetarium that can realistically simulate various astronomical phenomena. So we wondered if we could design a simplified space simulation website. Because limited by the amount of data we need to build our website, we decided to narrow it down to the solar system.

In order to give the website even greater value, we consider whether the project should be defined as a science education web site. Therefore, we define the target users for primary school students (grade 3-5). Our reasons are that for those senior students, the knowledge on this website is too easy to understand, but for lower grade students, they can accept the teaching of more cartoon images rather than star simulation.

Therefore, at this stage, we finally defined the project as a solar system science education website designed for primary school students (grade 3-5).

## Research

After completing the product definition, we entered the research phase, where our main task is to carry out user research, that is, to conduct surveys on the preferences of our target customers and user interviews.

In the target user survey phase, we have selected a online questionnaire survey (the link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdShmdtJ28hLWOyjzNJAB9QbDjUajekX9mi21D9FOyo1Ju_g/viewform?usp=sf_link). There are three parts in the questionnaire, which are for parents, teachers and students.

For the questionnaire for parents, we focused on obtaining parents' preference for the composition of online science education websites. Through the investigation of teachers, we can know the information of effective teaching mode. Since students are our target users, we pay more attention to the expectations of this group for science education websites.

In addition, we also conducted interviews with several target users through social media (due to the COVID, online communication is the safest and most convenient way).

## Analysis

Through research phase, we got data for analysis stage. Our main task at this stage is creating user personas and stories as well as connecting both by using storyboarding.

The user of our website is a third year student in Bristol. He is very interested in the solar system and frequently visits science education websites such as NASA. He had a very strong learning initiative, trying to find some dynamic simulations of the solar system.

As a pupil interested in astronomy, he wants to understand the relative positions of the sun and other eight planets in the solar system, so as to have a preliminary understanding of the solar system.

As an astronomy enthusiast, he wants to know the detailed introduction of each planet in the solar system, so as to further understand the solar system.

As a learner, he wants to take a test of knowledge of the solar system in order to understand his mastery of knowledge.

## Design

After getting clear about usersâ€™ wants, needs, and expectations, we move to the design phase. At this stage, we mainly complete early prototyping and ideation which includs mood boards and paper prototyping.

Mood boards contain the elements that will be put together to form the final version of the project, providing inspiration and direction. The mood board below shows that the colors of our page are varied, due to the different colors of the planets in our solar system, which is in sharp contrast to the black background. In addition, our theme was inspired by The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy, a science fiction novel, so we also put up movie posters.

The two images below are paper prototypes of the site. The first image is the home page of the website, which is divided into four parts from top to bottom: the title, the table of contents, the solar system simulation diagram and the logo of each planet.

When the user clicks "Presentation", the page goes to the home page (the default). When the user moves the cursor over a planet, a bubble box containing information about that planet is displayed.

When the user clicks "Test," the page jumps to the TEST page (shown in the second image). Our design is that when you jump to the page, the first question will be displayed automatically, and the timer in the upper right corner will start the timer. The answer page consists of two parts, the left side shows the questions, and the right four rectangles are the answers.

According to the paper prototype, we have also preliminarily drawn the product prototype, that is, the concept map of our product on the web side. The file is attached at the address: [./doc/Solarsystem.rp].
